			/* 1. determine who plays Black and is thus first.
			 * 2. choose to remove 2 pieces if not first (another variant has the removal of one piece by each player).
			 *
			 *     **GAME LOOP**    *
			 * 3. wait for input or make input
			 * 4. upon AI move:

			 * run legalmove on each position in array when is turn (and board is accurate.)
			 * N,S,E,W determines legalmove direction.
			 *
			 * the following bounds due to no move possible:
			 * if i<2 (row) don't run N
			 * if i>5 don't run S,
			 *
			 * if j<2 (column) don't run W,
			 * if j>5 don't run E.
			 *
			 * so the first square in a column doesn't evaluate the Northern most move and the last square will not
			 * evaluate the Southernmost... etc
			 * ******************* RECURSIVE CALLS  ***************************
			 * 5. if legalmove returns true, form node (recursive call with new board) with move and repeat process board to obtain number.
			 * it is a DFS.
			 * 6. the calls eventually reach depth d and the SEF is run.  It is notable that the alpha and beta cutoffs will reduce the number of boards evaluated
			 * WITHOUT any data loss.
			 * (this is a less intuitive action of the recursive function, no data is lost, but branches that the AI will NEVER select are not explored further.
			 * essentially, a node which comes out too high or too low relative to the node examined will not be selected)
			 *
			 **************	State Evaluation function (SEF)*********************
			 *
			 * 7. The SEF evaluates partly by counting legal moves for player in that state.
			 * Additionally, it counts pieces and estimates based on expected piece balance (each move must remove one piece, if more pieces are missing a
			 * double move has occurred.  The SEF assumes that this is bad for the player who had this happen to it.)
			 *
			 * The SEF value is passed up to the top of the tree with varied modifications, minimizing levels take the lowest value to pass, maximizing
			 * will take up the largest values
			 *
			 * Dir can = 0 for N (up), 1 for E(right), 2 for S (down), 3 for W (left)
